# Face-Recognition-Mitigation-Methods
In this repository, we implemented a mitigation method against privacy violation attacks on face recognition (FR) systems.

This repository contains the FR system that the mitigation method will work on it. Also, this repository supports existing publicly available privacy violation attacks (membership inference, model inversion, etc..).
