# Face-Recognition-Mitigation-Methods
In this repository, we implemented a mitigation method against privacy violation attacks on face recognition (FR) systems.

This repository contains the FR system that the mitigation method will work on it. Also, this repository supports existing publicly available privacy violation attacks (membership inference, model inversion, etc..).


In addition, we have included a demo app that allows users to test the model with their own images or images from the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset.

We hope that this method can be a helpful tool in promoting privacy and security in the use of face recognition technology.
